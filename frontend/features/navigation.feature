# Feature: User Navigation
#     As a user signing up with DBS
#     I want to be able to fill up the form smoothly
#     So that I am able to have a positive experience signing up

#     Scenario:  
#         Given I am on <page>
#         When I click on the next button
#         Then I should move forward to the <next> page

    # # FIXME: Passport page does not work unless everything has been filled out
    # Examples:
    # | page       | next       |
    # | "signup"   | "details"  |
    # | "passport" | "review"   |
    # | "review"   | "success"  |

    # Scenario:
    #     Given I am on <page>
    #     When I click on the back button
    #     Then I should go back to the <previous> page
    
    # # FIXME: Passport page does not work unless everything has been filled out
    # Examples:
    #     | previous   | page       |
    #     | ""         | "signup"   |
    #     | "details"  | "passport" |
    #     | "passport" | "review"   |
