# Feature: User Navigation
#     As a user signing up with DBS
#     I want to be able to fill up the form smoothly
#     So that I am able to have a positive experience signing up

#     Scenario:  
#         Given I am on <page>
#         When I click on the next button
#         Then I should move forward to the <next> page

#     Examples:
#     | page       | next       |
#     | "signup"   | "details"  |
#     | "passport" | "review"   |
#     | "review"   | "success"  |

#     Scenario:
#         Given I am on <page>
#         When I click on the back button
#         Then I should go back to the <previous> page
        
#     Examples:
#         | previous   | page       |
#         | ""         | "signup"   |
#         | "details"  | "passport" |
#         | "passport" | "review"   |
